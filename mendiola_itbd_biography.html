  <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I’m Sherisse Nicolle H. Mendiola, I was born on October 2, 2004 in Malolos City Bulacan.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Palipat lipat kami ng tirahan that’s why my childhood days were really fun since I got to experience it in different environments.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I studied and lived in Cavite for 3-5 years.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I graduated from my preschool there and finished grade 1 and 2 tapos lumipat na kami sa Bulacan.<sup><b>4</b></sup> While studying in Cavite, I was very active in joining school activities such as quiz bee and dancing for buwan ng wika.<sup><b>5</b></sup> I joined english and math quiz bee and got first in both when I was in grade 2.<sup><b>6</b></sup> I was a consistent honor student that time and I’m really grade conscious too.<sup><b>7</b></sup> I remember how the english quiz bee went it’s like a crossword puzzle and you have to find the words.<sup><b>8</b></sup> I was really nervous kasi yung pinakamatalino from the other section was there and katabi ko pa siya.<sup><b>9</b></sup> I finished the crossword puzzle first and hindi ko na dinouble check kasi baka maunahan pa niya ako kaya dali-dali kong pinasa agad and luckily tama lahat.<sup><b>10</b></sup> In Cavite, I got to experience things like playing outside sa bukid, since katabi lang ng tinitirahan namin na apartment.<sup><b>11</b></sup> I remember playing with my cousins tagu-taguan at night outside and we were scaring each other that there’s a manananggal then we’re going to run home crying.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Then my favorite thing to do there was using a waveboard, me and my cousins raced each other and kung sino matalo ay manlilibre.<sup><b>13</b></sup> Another is whenever we see a doorbell, we’re going to press it then run as fast as we can.<sup><b>14</b></sup> I remember that we love alateris fruit, may kapitbahay kasi kaming may puno ng alateris lagi kami kumuha doon without permission kaya napapagalitan kami.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Ang nasa isip kasi namin noon na sayang ang alateris kasi hindi rin naman nila kinakain like it’s for display only.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Then there’s one instance where there were two turkeys in the middle of the street, we’re going to buy stuff sa tindahan when the turkeys chased us, then we ran so fast I almost tripped.<sup><b>17</b></sup> Me and my cousins used to have a dance number every christmas, and my favorite was dancing to <em>2NE1</em> song which is <em>FIRE</em> and it’s really embarrassing kapag naaalala ko.<sup><b>18</b></sup> In Bulacan, I took swimming classes, made new friends sa school, and nagkaroon ng chickens na na-massacre ng mga dogs namin.<sup><b>19</b></sup> These are the things that I love and can’t forget about my childhood.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

  <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my teenage years, I can say that this was the most traumatizing and lowest point in my life but meron di namang good things that I experienced in my teenage years.<sup><b>1</b></sup> I studied and graduated high school and senior high school in Malolos, Bulacan.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I started to learn guitar and ukulele noong 7th grade.<sup><b>3</b></sup> I auditioned for my school’s choir and got accepted pero due to my school schedule, hindi ko na ito tinuloy dahil ang nasa isip ko noon ay makakaapekto ito sa studies ko that time.<sup><b>4</b></sup> In 9th grade, dapat ay may ipe-perform kami na musical play called <em><b>“Hamilton”</b></em> pero hindi ito natuloy because of the COVID-19 pandemic.<sup><b>5</b></sup> Dito rin nag start ang love ko for musicals including <em><b>“The Sound of Music”</b></em> which is my all time favorite musical show.<sup><b>6</b></sup> I can say that the pandemic really messed up my mental health, nasira ang sleeping schedule, and nawalan ng motivation to study which was weird kasi i’m grade conscious.<sup><b>7</b></sup> Noong grade 10 ako, this is the first time na nagkaroon ng online classes and lahat tayo ay nag-aadjust to new learning modalities.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Wala akong masyadong natututunan kasi nawawalan ako ng ganang mag-aral and nahihirapan akong mag-focus since nasa bahay lang at maraming distractions.<sup><b>9</b></sup>Dahil dito, I got a blank grade kasi I wasn’t able to pass and finish some activities na kailangan.<sup><b>10</b></sup> I blamed myself kasi sarili ko lang din naman ang may kagagawan nito, feel ko rin that time na i’m a failure and not enough since grade conscious ako but thankful ako sa parents ko dahil supportive pa rin sila even though na nakakuha ako ng blank grade and nakabawi naman ako and graduated high school with honor.<sup><b>11</b></sup> Next is when I was in 11th grade, I got diagnosed with hyperthyroidism or graves’ disease which really affects everything including my mental health.<sup><b>12</b></sup> Umabot sa point na mabilis akong magalit, I can’t even understand myself, had a massive hair loss, yung left side ng head ko walang hair, I hated myself and my self-esteem was really low.<sup><b>13</b></sup> I used to cry about these every single night, pretending that everything’s alright in the morning.<sup><b>14</b></sup> Medyo nakakapagod lang since I have monthly checkups and I need to take medications na habang buhay.<sup><b>15</b></sup> In 12th grade, medyo challenging since graduating and research defense but kinaya naman even though there were problems including my sickness and groupmates.<sup><b>16</b></sup> They were my friends but lagi akong naleleftout that’s why I decided to slowly detach myself from them and survive the remaining days with them.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I graduated with honor and swear to myself that I will not study here at Bulacan because I don’t want to see them again.<sup><b>18</b></sup> I actually hate my teenage years because it was too toxic for me and I don’t have a lot of good memories with it.<sup><b>19</b></sup> Even though a lot of things happened, I’m very thankful for those people who helped me and stayed when i’m at my lowest.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>

  <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My college experience however was a lot better than my teenage years.<sup><b>1</b></sup> Noong naghahanap ng school na aking papasukan, my first choice was University of Makita because I heard from my friend there that the education was nice and the environment too but it’s too far away from my home.<sup><b>2</b></sup> I took the entrance exam at Bulacan State University without reviewing kasi I really don’t want to study here at Bulacan, kaya hindi rin ako pumasa.<sup><b>3</b></sup> My mother told me that I should apply sa University of the East since dito rin siya nagtapos ng college, kaya I’m studying here now sa <abbr title="Univeristy of the East">UE</abbr>.<sup><b>4</b></sup> I met a lot of friends here and had a circle of good friends.<sup><b>5</b></sup> At first college, is very scary but really exciting kasi it’s a new environment for me, galing pa ako sa probinsya and wala akong alam sa Manila.<sup><b>6</b></sup> It’s my first time na sumakay sa bus, jeep and <abbr title="Light Rail Transit">LRT</abbr> mag-isa, sobrang gandang experience kasi pwede akong mag explore.<sup><b>7</b></sup> During first year college, sobrang kabado ako kasi I don’t know how people act here sa Manila if same lang ba sa probinsya or like mga mayayaman ang mga tao dito or medyo classy.<sup><b>8</b></sup> Naaalala ko rin na sobrang takot ako magtanong tao at baka i-judge ako but sobrang babait nila.<sup><b>9</b></sup> Gumigising ako ng 4:30AM everyday to prepare then aalis sa bahay ng 5:30AM, medyo nakakapagod but nakakapagadjust naman na ang aking katawan.<sup><b>10</b></sup> Maganda ang schedule ko since it was 8AM to 12:30AM, kaya maaga ang uwi ko dati and may time pa na gumala with friends or with myself.<sup><b>11</b></sup> There’s one time na nag try ako na libutin ang different train stations sa <abbr title="Light Rail Transit 1">LRT1</abbr>, <abbr title="Light Rail Transit 2">LRT2</abbr> and <abbr title="Metro Rail Transit 3">MRT3</abbr> since magkakaconnect lang naman sila, I can say that masaya pala mag ikot-ikot kung saan-saan.<sup><b>12</b></sup> I learned the different and fastest route going to school kaya early bird talaga ako, ayaw ko na ma-late ako kasi nakakahiya and ayaw ko na pagtitinginan nila ako.<sup><b>13</b></sup> My favorite memory noong first year ay ang pag nood ko sa <abbr title="Univeristy Athletic Association of the Philippines">UAAP</abbr>, it’s my first time to watch it and sobrang memorable sa akin yun.<sup><b>14</b></sup> I didn’t expect it to be exciting kasi akala ko tutulugan ko lang yun but hindi, kasama ako sa nagsisisigaw to cheer our UE MBT sa laban nila.<sup><b>15</b></sup> Ngayong 2nd year, medyo draining since yung schedule right now ay full day and kailangan ko pa umuwi sa Bulacan.<sup><b>16</b></sup> Daming deadlines and activities but kinaya naman ang first semester which sobrang proud ako sa sarili ko na kinaya ko pa rin kahit mahirap and wala naman talagang madali sa buhay kaya it’s alright.<sup><b>17</b></sup> I experienced going to Antipolo for the first time with my college friends, yun ang pinakamalayo kong napuntahan and ang ganda ng view there sa Ahon Coffee and Cloud 9.<sup><b>18</b></sup> I learned that I should get out of my comfort zone and explore new things, if mayroong problems or minor inconvenience take time to rest then bangon ulit.<sup><b>19</b></sup> I’m really enjoying my time here sa <abbr title="University of the East">UE</abbr> and I never regret choosing to study here in Manila.<sup><b>20</b></sup></blockquote></blockquote></p>
